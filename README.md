# Using Winlator with accessibility for blind and visually impaired    # credits [guiador, in audiogames fórum!](https://forum.audiogames.net/post/898032/#p898032)  ** Winlator ** is an emulator designed to run Windows applications on Android devices. However, its accessibility is not native, requiring adjustments to allow blind or visually impaired people to use it efficiently. Next, steps are described to configure the emulator and make it accessible.    ## 1. Initial configuration    Before creating a container, you need to configure multiple elements to ensure accessibility. Below are the essential adjustments:    - ** Talkback is not compatible **, so it must be deactivated.   - The ** jieshuo **, along with your virtual screen, can be used for OCR in some situations.   - A ** physical keyboard, gamepad or similar device ** is required to map main keys.   - The version of ** NVDA ** to be used depends on the emulated operating system:     - Windows XP → Version 2017.     - Windows 7 (standard on the emulator) → version 2023.     - Windows 10 or 11 → latest version available.    ## 2. Creation of the container    To create a new container in the winlator, follow these steps:    1. Press the ** "Add" ** button and follow the assistant.   2. Explore the different tabs and select the desired configuration:      - **Screen**      - ** Audio **      - ** Source **      - ** Background Plan **      - ** Version of drivers and operating system **   3. If any term is unknown, it is recommended to research forums or consult an AI.   4. At the end, press the ** "Confirm" ** button.    ## 3. Accessibility in the emulator    The emulator ** does not have native accessibility ** and does not have an integrated screen reader. In addition, it allows startup in different charging modes (only essential services or all services).    ## 4. Additional configuration in jieshuo    Some settings within ** jieshuo ** need to be adjusted to improve emulator interaction:    1. Access the ** stock settings ** option.   2. Go to ** settings of predefined gestures **.   3. Select ** Border gestures **.   4. Activate the option ** "Lower Border" ** gestures.   5. Swear to the right and left on the edge of the screen to test. ## 5. Access to files within the emulator    Each container created has two main buttons:    - ** Run the emulator **.   - ** Access useful shortcuts **.    To install NVDA inside the emulator:    1. Access the second button and find the file explorer option.   2. The NVDA installer should be ** previously downloaded ** on mobile or moved to the download folder.   3. Within the emulator, the ** unit D: ** corresponds to the download folder.   4. Open the explorer and locate three main buttons:      - ** View ** (to explore subfats).      - ** Run ** (to run files).      - ** Menu **.   5.Find the NVDA installer and press ** "Run" ** to start the installation.    ## 6. Keyboard configuration on emulator    When running the NVDA installer, the ** keyboard will not yet be functional **, as the emulator uses a fingertips controlled touch cursor. To activate it:    1. Use the ** gesture back ** (previously activated in the jieshuo) to open a submenu.   2. Select ** input controls **.   3. Choose a predefined ** profile **, like ** rts **.   4. Access the ** configuration option within the profile **.   5. In the options of ** keyboard detected **, press each physical key and assign a function.   6. It is recommended ** temporarily disable Jieshuo ** to avoid interference with keys such as arrows, tab, space bar and enter.   7. After each assignment, a screen will be displayed to define if the key belongs to a keyboard, control or other device.   8. At the end, press ** ok ** or ** confirm **.    ## 7. Interaction with NVDA in the emulator    After the keyboard configuration, it will be possible to interact with the ** NVDA ** both during the installation and in the emulated system.    ### FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS    - ** Disable Jieshuo ** while using the emulator to avoid conflict.   - The ** "game" mode of Jieshuo ** is not enough, as it can still interfere with some parts of the emulator.    With these settings, it is possible to use Winlator accessible, ensuring greater independence for blind users and visually impaired. Although some areas still need improvements, this method allows a more functional experience within the emulator.
